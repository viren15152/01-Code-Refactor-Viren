# Week-1-Code-Refactor-Viren
**HTML CSS Git Code Refractor Challenge**:
I have refactored a codebase to meet the users story. 

**User Story: AS A marketing agency**
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

I have done this so that it meets user accessibility standards. 
I have refactored the code base so that it utilizes the correct semantic HTML elements. 
I have ensured that the elements follow the logical structure independent of styling and positioning and that they fall in sequential order.

**Breakdown of the HTML changes that I have made:**
I have removed the closing tag for the meta tags added name and content to improve SEO.
Implemented a new title so that it is concise and and descriptive e.g. Horiseon Social Solution Service, Inc.
I have changed a div to a header,I added a semantic HTML element id="nav to the div.
I changed the div tag to nav in order to create a navigation toolbar.
I have replaced the div elements with aside elements as this part is the sidebar on the website.
I also changed the div to footer.
