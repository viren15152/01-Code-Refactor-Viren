HTML CSS Git Code Refractor Challenge:
I have refactored a codebase to meet the users story. 
I have done this so that it meets user accessibility standards. 
I have refactored the code base so that it utilizes the correct semantic HTML elements. 
I have ensured that the elements follow the logical structure independent of styling and positioning and that they fall in sequential order.
